AI Messenger with Scheduled Announcements and Text-to-Speech is a smart communication tool designed to automate the scheduling and delivery of announcements in organizations, classrooms, or public settings. By integrating text-to-speech (TTS) technology, the system converts textual announcements into clear and natural-sounding audio messages, enhancing accessibility and engagement. This project aims to streamline communication workflows by ensuring timely, consistent, and automated dissemination of important messages without the need for manual intervention.

Key Features
Scheduled Announcement Management:
Users can create announcements and specify the exact date and time for delivery. Multiple announcements can be queued, modified, or canceled as needed.

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Integration:
Converts plain text announcements into audio files using TTS engines such as Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). This allows announcements to be broadcasted as speech, improving clarity and accessibility, especially in noisy environments or for visually impaired users.

User Interface:
The project provides either a Command Line Interface (CLI) or a simple GUI (built with Tkinter or Flask) for users to manage announcements easily. The interface allows scheduling, editing, previewing, and deleting announcements.

Automated Announcement Delivery:
Using Python scheduling libraries (schedule or APScheduler), the system automatically triggers the playback or sending of announcements at the scheduled times without manual prompts.

Audio Playback and Export:
The generated speech files can be played directly via the system or exported for use on other platforms or devices.

Custom Notification Settings:
Users can set preferences for notification frequency, message repetition, or selective announcement types.

Usage Instructions

Create an Announcement:
Input the message text and specify the date/time for delivery.

Manage Announcements:
List all scheduled announcements, edit or delete any entry.

Preview Announcement:
Optionally listen to the converted audio before scheduling.

Automated Delivery:
Once scheduled, the system automatically plays or sends the announcement at the specified time.

Logs and Notifications:
The system logs delivery status and errors, notifying users of any issues.

Example Use Case
An educational institute uses the AI Messenger to schedule daily reminders for class timings and events. The staff creates announcements once and the system automatically plays them in the school’s PA system.

Future Enhancements
Multi-platform Message Delivery:
Integration with messaging apps like Slack, WhatsApp, or email to send audio/text announcements.

Multilingual Support:
Add support for multiple languages and accents for TTS.

Web/Mobile Interface:
Develop responsive web or mobile apps for easier remote management.

Analytics Dashboard:
Track delivery success, audience engagement, and message reach.

Voice Customization:
Allow users to select different voices, speeds, and tones.
